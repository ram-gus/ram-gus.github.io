## About Me
I am a PhD graduated in Electronics and Telecommunications at [CICESE](https://posgrados.cicese.mx) in Ensenada, Mexico. [My research](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6387-4504) focuses on signal and image processing, embedded devices, and satellite attitude determination algorithms. I have developed a [star identification algorithm](https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace10090748) for satellite and plate-solving devices, using catalogs from the Gaia mission (DR2 and DR3) and Python libraries like Astropy. I am skilled in programming for microcontrollers such as STM32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, as well as programming languages like Python, Matlab, and C/C++. I also have extensive experience with GNU/Linux systems and other operating systems, such as Windows and MacOS. My passion for technology drives my continuous learning and development in these areas.
