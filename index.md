## About Me
I am a PhD graduated in Electronics and Telecommunications at [CICESE](https://posgrados.cicese.mx) in Ensenada, Mexico. [My research](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6387-4504) focuses on signal and image processing, embedded devices, and satellite attitude determination algorithms. I have developed a [star identification algorithm](https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace10090748) for satellite and plate-solving devices, using catalogs from the Gaia mission (DR2 and DR3) and Python libraries like Astropy. 

I am skilled in programming for microcontrollers such as STM32, Arduino and ESP32, as well as programming languages like Python, Matlab, and C/C++. I also have extensive experience with GNU/Linux systems and other operating systems, such as Windows and MacOS. Fan of embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano.

I have been part of the [LaTTE](https://posgrados.cicese.mx/posgrado/laboratorio/62/8/2) (Laboratorio de Telecomunicaciones y Tecnolog√≠a Aeroespacial / Laboratory of Telecommunications and Aerospace Technology) laboratory and am currently a Part-time Professor in Computer Organization and Architecture at the [Facultad de Ciencias, UABC](https://ciencias.ens.uabc.mx) and [UNIENS](https://universidaddeensenada.edu.mx).
