## About Me
I am a PhD in Electronics and Telecommunications at CICESE in Ensenada, Mexico. My research focuses on signal and image processing, embedded devices, and satellite attitude determination algorithms. I have developed a star identification algorithm for satellite and plate-solving devices, using catalogs from the Gaia mission (DR2 and DR3) and Python libraries like Astropy. I am skilled in programming for microcontrollers such as STM32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, as well as programming languages like Python, Matlab, and C/C++. I also have extensive experience with GNU/Linux systems and other operating systems, such as Windows and MacOS. My passion for technology drives my continuous learning and development in these areas.
